## 💰 Cost

### SMS Costs (Twilio)
- **Per SMS**: ~$0.0075 USD
- **Recipients**: 2 (Riley + Neal)
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Daily SMS**: 288 runs × 2 recipients = 576 SMS
- **Daily Cost**: $4.32
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$130

### AI Costs (OpenAI)
- **Per Summary**: ~200-300 tokens
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per summary
- **Daily Cost**: ~$0.03

**Total Monthly**: ~$131 for full SMS coverage

### Cost Optimization Options

If costs are too high, you can:

1. **Reduce Frequency** - Send SMS only on significant changes
2. **Batch Updates** - Send one summary every 30 minutes instead of 5
3. **Smart Filtering** - Only send if sentiment changes significantly
4. **Single Recipient** - Remove one recipient to cut costs in half

To implement batching, modify `server.py` scheduled_job:
```python
# Only send SMS every 6th run (30 minutes)
if run.id % 6 == 0:
    # Send SMS
```

Edit `server.py` the `summary_prompt` to customize:
- Summary style
- Key insight focus

### Filter News

To only send SMS when significant changes occur:

```python
# In server.py, before sending SMS
significant_change = (
    run.inserted > 5 or  # More than 5 new articles
    pos_count > neg_count * 2 or  # Strong bullish
    neg_count > pos_count * 2  # Strong bearish
)

if significant_change:

2. Restart backend: `python3 -m uvicorn app.server:app --reload --port 8001`
3. Check logs for Twilio initialization

]
```
