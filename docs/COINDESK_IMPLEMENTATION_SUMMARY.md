# CoinDesk News Scraping - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

Successfully enhanced the news fetching API to scrape crypto news from **CoinDesk** in addition to the existing Crypto News API.

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
Added web scraping libraries:
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` - HTML/XML parsing
- `lxml>=4.9.0` - Fast parser backend for BeautifulSoup

### 2. Enhanced News Service (`app/news_service.py`)

#### Added Imports
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

#### New Constant
```python
COINDESK_NEWS_URL = 'https://www.coindesk.com/latest-crypto-news'
```

#### New Function: `scrape_coindesk_news()`
- Fetches the CoinDesk latest news page
- Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup
- Extracts article data:
  - Title (from `<h2>` in links with class `content-card-title`)
  - URL (converts relative paths to absolute URLs)
  - Description (from `<p>` tags with `font-body` class)
  - Image URL (from `<img>` tags, handles Next.js image optimization)
  - Publication time (from `<span>` with `font-metadata` class)
  - Source (hardcoded as "CoinDesk")
- Returns list of article dictionaries matching the API format

#### Updated Function: `fetch_and_store_news()`
```python
# Added after fetching from Crypto News API:
coindesk_items = scrape_coindesk_news()
items.extend(coindesk_items)
```

This combines articles from both sources before storing them in the database.

### 3. Documentation

Created two documentation files:

- **`COINDESK_NEWS.md`** - User-facing documentation explaining the feature
- **`COINDESK_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file, technical implementation summary

## üéØ How It Works

### Flow

1. **Scheduled Task** triggers news fetch (every 5 minutes)
2. **News Service** fetches from:
   - Crypto News API (with sentiment & tickers)
   - CoinDesk website (scraped HTML)
3. **Articles Combined** into single list
4. **Deduplication** by URL (prevents duplicates)
5. **Database Storage** with UTC date normalization
6. **API Endpoint** (`/api/news`) returns all articles
7. **Frontend** displays combined news feed

### Data Structure

CoinDesk articles follow the same format as API articles:

```python
{
    'news_url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/...',
    'title': 'Article Title',
    'text': 'Article description...',
    'image_url': 'https://cdn.sanity.io/...',
    'source_name': 'CoinDesk',
    'date': '5 minutes ago',  # Relative time
    'type': 'Article',
    'sentiment': None,  # Not available from scraping
    'tickers': []  # Not available from scraping
}
```

## üß™ Testing

Tested the scraper with a temporary test script that:
1. Called `scrape_coindesk_news()`
2. Verified article count (successfully scraped 16 articles)
3. Inspected article data structure
4. Confirmed all fields populated correctly

Test results:
- ‚úÖ 16 articles successfully scraped
- ‚úÖ Titles extracted correctly
- ‚úÖ URLs converted to absolute paths
- ‚úÖ Descriptions extracted
- ‚úÖ Image URLs handled (including Next.js optimization)
- ‚úÖ Publication times captured

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Dual News Sources** - More comprehensive market coverage
2. **Quality Journalism** - CoinDesk is a trusted crypto news leader
3. **No Additional Costs** - Web scraping is free (no API fees)
4. **Seamless Integration** - Works with existing news infrastructure
5. **Automatic Updates** - Runs on the same 5-minute schedule
6. **Backward Compatible** - Doesn't break existing functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

### Date Format
CoinDesk provides relative times ("5 minutes ago") instead of ISO timestamps. The `parse_date()` function may not parse these, so they're stored as-is. Frontend displays them unchanged.

### No Sentiment Analysis
Unlike the Crypto News API, scraped articles don't include sentiment scores (Positive/Negative/Neutral).

### No Ticker Tags
CoinDesk articles aren't automatically tagged with cryptocurrency tickers. Future enhancement could use NLP to extract tickers from titles/content.

### Web Scraping Fragility
If CoinDesk changes their HTML structure, the scraper may break. The code includes:
- Robust error handling (fails gracefully)
- Fallback logic for missing elements
- Logging for debugging

### User-Agent Required
Uses a browser user-agent to avoid being blocked as a bot.

## üîß Maintenance

### If Scraping Stops Working

1. **Check HTML structure** - CoinDesk may have updated their layout
2. **Inspect the page** - Visit `https://www.coindesk.com/latest-crypto-news` in browser
3. **Update selectors** - Modify class names/tags in `scrape_coindesk_news()`
4. **Test changes** - Create a test script to verify before deploying

### Monitoring

The scraper includes print statements:
```python
print(f"Scraped {len(articles)} articles from CoinDesk")
print(f"Error scraping CoinDesk: {e}")
```

Check logs to monitor scraping health.

## üì¶ Deployment

### Installation
```bash
cd /Users/rileymartin/tradingbot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### No Configuration Required
CoinDesk scraping works out-of-the-box. No API keys or environment variables needed.

### Restart Backend
```bash
# If backend is running:
# Stop it (Ctrl+C) and restart:
python3 -m uvicorn app.server:app --reload --port 8001
```

## üéâ Summary

The trading bot now fetches crypto news from two sources:
1. **Crypto News API** - Structured data with sentiment & tickers
2. **CoinDesk** - Latest news via web scraping

Both sources are automatically fetched every 5 minutes and displayed together in the frontend dashboard. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and requires no additional configuration.
