## Strategy Overview

### What is a Trading Strategy?

A trading strategy is a set of rules that determines when to BUY and SELL. Each strategy:
- Analyzes market data (price, volume, indicators)
- Generates signals (BUY, SELL, or HOLD)
- Has its own logic and approach
- Works better in different market conditions

### How Bots Use Strategies

```
1. Bot fetches latest price data from Binance
2. Bot passes data to strategy
3. Strategy analyzes and returns signal
4. Bot executes the trade if signal is BUY or SELL
5. Process repeats every 15 minutes
```

## How Strategies Work

### Technical Analysis Strategies

These use **math and statistics** on price/volume data:

**Common Indicators:**
- **RSI** (Relative Strength Index): Measures overbought/oversold
- **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Trend momentum
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility and price ranges
- **EMA** (Exponential Moving Average): Price trends
- **Volume**: Trading activity strength

**Example Logic:**
```
IF RSI < 30 (oversold)
AND MACD crosses above signal line
AND price near lower Bollinger Band
THEN ‚Üí BUY signal

IF RSI > 70 (overbought)  
AND MACD crosses below signal line
AND price near upper Bollinger Band
THEN ‚Üí SELL signal
```

### AI-Powered Strategies

These combine **technical analysis + news sentiment**:

**How They Work:**
1. Fetch crypto news from CryptoNews API
2. Use OpenAI (ChatGPT) to analyze sentiment
3. Calculate technical indicators
4. Combine both for final decision

**Example:**
```
Technical Analysis: SELL signal (overbought)
News Sentiment: VERY POSITIVE (major adoption news)
Final Decision: HOLD (news overrides technical)
```
