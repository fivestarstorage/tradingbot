# 📱 SMS Notifications with AI Reasoning

## **What's New?**

SMS notifications now include **AI reasoning** behind each trade!

### **Before:**
```
🟢 BUY ALERT - SOL News Bot

Coin: SOLUSDT
Price: $122.50
Quantity: 4.8979
Total: $600.00

💰 Position opened!
```

### **After (with AI reasoning):**
```
🟢 BUY ALERT - SOL News Bot

Coin: SOLUSDT
Price: $122.50
Quantity: 4.8979
Total: $600.00

💰 Position opened!

💡 Reasoning:
The overall sentiment surrounding Solana (SOL) is overwhelmingly positive, with multiple articles highlighting bullish price predictions, significant revenue growth, and upcoming technical upgrades. The anticipation of a potential ETF approval further enhances the bullish outlook. Additionally, the broader market is experiencing a rally led by Bitcoin, which typically benefits altcoins like SOL.
```

## **How It Works**

### **1. AI Strategies Generate Reasoning**

When AI strategies analyze news and make trading decisions, they provide detailed reasoning:

```python
# From ai_autonomous_strategy.py
return {
    'signal': 'BUY',
    'confidence': 85,
    'reasoning': 'The overall sentiment surrounding Solana...',
    'recommended_symbol': 'SOLUSDT'
}
```

### **2. Bot Passes Reasoning to SMS**

The `integrated_trader.py` extracts reasoning from the strategy and includes it in the SMS notification:

```python
# If AI provides reasoning, include it
if signal_data and 'reasoning' in signal_data:
    notification_data['reasoning'] = signal_data['reasoning']

sms_notifier.send_trade_notification(notification_data)
```

### **3. Twilio Formats and Sends**

The `twilio_notifier.py` formats the message with reasoning:

```python
# Add AI reasoning if provided
if reasoning:
    # Truncate if too long (SMS limit)
    if len(reasoning) > 400:
        reasoning = reasoning[:397] + "..."
    
    message += f"\n\n💡 Reasoning:\n{reasoning}"
```

🟢 BUY ALERT - {Bot Name}

Coin: {SYMBOL}
Price: ${price}
Quantity: {qty}
Total: ${amount}

💰 Position opened!

💡 Reasoning:

```

### **SELL Alert with Reasoning:**
```
🔴 SELL ALERT - {Bot Name}

Quantity: {qty}
Total: ${amount}

📈 Profit: +$50.00 (+8.33%)

💡 Reasoning:

```

## **Which Strategies Include Reasoning?**

### **✅ Strategies with AI Reasoning:**

1. **AI Autonomous** - Comprehensive news analysis
   ```
   Reasoning: "Multiple bullish indicators detected across 
   5 articles. Bitcoin's rally is lifting altcoins, and 
   SOL shows strong technical support at $120..."
   ```

2. **AI News Trading** - Sentiment-based decisions
   ```
   Reasoning: "Strong positive sentiment (85%) detected. 
   Key drivers: ETF anticipation, revenue growth, and 
   upcoming technical upgrades..."
   ```

3. **Ticker News Trading** - Coin-specific news
   ```
   Reasoning: "SOL-specific news shows bullish momentum. 
   Network upgrades scheduled for Q4, institutional 
   interest increasing..."
   ```

### **❌ Strategies WITHOUT AI Reasoning:**

1. **Simple Profitable** - Technical indicators only
   ```
   No reasoning (uses RSI, MACD, volume)
   SMS will show trade details only
   ```

2. **Conservative** - Technical strategy
   ```
   No reasoning (uses technical analysis)
   SMS will show trade details only
   ```

3. **Breakout** - Price action based
   ```
   No reasoning (uses breakout detection)
   SMS will show trade details only
   ```

## **SMS Length Limits**

### **Twilio Limits:**
- Single SMS: 160 characters
- Concatenated SMS: Up to 1,600 characters
- Our limit: **400 characters for reasoning**

### **Why 400 Characters?**

```
Trade info: ~150 characters
Reasoning: ~400 characters
Buffer: ~50 characters
Total: ~600 characters (fits in 4 concatenated SMS)

Cost: ~4 SMS segments per trade
```

### **Truncation:**

If AI reasoning exceeds 400 characters, it's automatically truncated:

```python
if len(reasoning) > 400:
    reasoning = reasoning[:397] + "..."
```

**Example:**
```
Original (450 chars):
"The overall sentiment surrounding Solana (SOL) is overwhelmingly positive, with multiple articles highlighting bullish price predictions, significant revenue growth, and upcoming technical upgrades. The anticipation of a potential ETF approval further enhances the bullish outlook. Additionally, the broader market is experiencing a rally led by Bitcoin, which typically benefits altcoins like SOL. Network metrics show increasing adoption..."

```
🟢 BUY ALERT - SOL AI Trader

Coin: SOLUSDT
Price: $122.50
Quantity: 4.8979
Total: $600.00

💰 Position opened!

💡 Reasoning:
Solana showing strong bullish momentum. Key factors: 1) Network upgrades scheduled for Q4 2025, 2) Institutional interest increasing with potential ETF approval, 3) Bitcoin rally lifting altcoins, 4) Technical support at $120 confirmed. AI confidence: 85%.
```

### **Example 2: SELL BTC (Risk Management)**

```
🔴 SELL ALERT - BTC News Bot

Coin: BTCUSDT
Price: $125,450.00
Quantity: 0.0048
Total: $601.92

📈 Profit: +$51.92 (+9.44%)

💡 Reasoning:
Regulatory concerns detected across multiple sources. SEC announcing stricter crypto regulations. Bitcoin showing bearish divergence on technical indicators. Risk management: taking profits while positive. AI recommends defensive positioning.
```

### **Example 3: SELL ETH (Stop-Loss)**

```
🔴 SELL ALERT - ETH Auto-Manager

Coin: ETHUSDT
Price: $4,244.70
Quantity: 0.1415
Total: $600.60

📉 Profit: -$17.40 (-2.82%)

💡 Reasoning:
Stop-loss triggered at -3%. Ethereum showing weakness following disappointing network metrics. Gas fees rising, causing user migration to L2s. Better to preserve capital for next opportunity. Market sentiment: mixed.
```

### **Example 4: BUY DOGE (Breaking News)**

```
🟢 BUY ALERT - DOGE Ticker Bot

Coin: DOGEUSDT
Price: $0.0872
Quantity: 6,880.7339

```

## **SMS Cost Estimates**

### **Without Reasoning:**
```
1 trade = ~1-2 SMS segments
Cost: ~$0.01-$0.02 per trade
10 trades/day = $0.10-$0.20/day
Monthly: $3-$6
```

### **With Reasoning:**
```
1 trade = ~3-4 SMS segments
Cost: ~$0.03-$0.04 per trade
10 trades/day = $0.30-$0.40/day
Monthly: $9-$12
```

### **Is It Worth It?**

```
Extra cost: ~$6/month
Benefit: Know WHY the AI traded
Value: Priceless for learning and trust!

✅ Absolutely worth it!
```

## **How to Enable/Disable Reasoning**

### **Reasoning is Automatic!**

If your strategy provides reasoning, it's automatically included in SMS.

### **To Disable (Not Recommended):**

Edit `twilio_notifier.py`:

```python
# Comment out the reasoning section:
# if reasoning:
#     message += f"\n\n💡 Reasoning:\n{reasoning}"
```

### **To Adjust Length Limit:**

Edit `twilio_notifier.py`:

```python
# Change from 400 to your preferred limit:
max_reasoning_length = 400  # Default
max_reasoning_length = 200  # Shorter (saves SMS cost)
max_reasoning_length = 600  # Longer (more detail)
```

---

## **Recipients**

SMS notifications are sent to:

```python
recipients = [
    {'name': 'Riley Martin', 'number': '+61431269296'},
    {'name': 'Neal Martin', 'number': '+61422335161'}
]
```

**Both numbers receive:**
- ✅ All trade alerts (BUY/SELL)
- ✅ AI reasoning (if available)
- ✅ Profit/loss details
- ✅ Bot status updates

---

## **Deployment**

### **Update Your Server:**

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@134.199.159.103
cd /root/tradingbot

# Fix git and pull
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull origin main

# Restart bots to use new SMS format
pkill -f "integrated_trader.py"

# Go to dashboard and restart bots
# http://134.199.159.103:5001
```

### **Test SMS with Reasoning:**

```bash
# Create a test trade notification
cd /root/tradingbot
python3 -c "
from twilio_notifier import TwilioNotifier
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

notifier = TwilioNotifier()

# Test BUY with reasoning
notifier.send_trade_notification({
    'action': 'BUY',
    'symbol': 'SOLUSDT',
    'price': 122.50,
    'quantity': 4.8979,
    'amount': 600.00,
    'bot_name': 'Test Bot',
    'reasoning': 'The overall sentiment surrounding Solana (SOL) is overwhelmingly positive, with multiple articles highlighting bullish price predictions, significant revenue growth, and upcoming technical upgrades.'
})

print('✅ Test SMS sent! Check your phone.')
"
```

## **FAQ**

### **Q: Will all my SMS messages be longer now?**
**A:** Only if the strategy provides reasoning (AI strategies). Technical strategies won't have reasoning, so their SMS will be the same length as before.

### **Q: Can I see the reasoning in the dashboard too?**
**A:** Yes! The dashboard already shows AI reasoning in the position details panel.

### **Q: What if reasoning is too long?**
**A:** It's automatically truncated to 400 characters to keep SMS costs reasonable.

### **Q: Can I customize which recipients get reasoning?**
**A:** Currently, all recipients get the same message. You'd need to modify `twilio_notifier.py` to send different messages to different numbers.

### **Q: Does this work for manual trades?**
**A:** No, only for bot-executed trades. Manual trades through Binance directly won't send SMS.

### **Q: What if Twilio isn't configured?**
**A:** The bot will skip SMS notifications entirely. Trading continues normally.

### **Q: Can I get reasoning for SELL signals too?**
**A:** Yes! Both BUY and SELL signals include reasoning if the AI provides it.
