## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Hybrid Scoring System

Every coin you hold gets three scores:

- **News Score (0-100)**: Sentiment from recent news articles (last 24h)
- **Technical Score (0-100)**: RSI, MACD, EMA, price momentum analysis
- **Hybrid Score (0-100)**: Weighted combination (40% news + 60% technical)

### 2. Intelligent Position Statuses

Based on the hybrid score:

- 🟢 **STRONG HOLD** (80-100): Excellent fundamentals + strong technicals
- 🟡 **HOLD** (60-79): Good overall, maintain position
- 🟠 **WEAK HOLD** (40-59): Mixed signals, monitor closely
- 🔴 **SELL NOW** (0-39): Weak on both fronts, exit recommended

### 3. Detailed Coin Insights

Click any coin to see:

- **📈 Price Chart**: Last 8 hours of price action
- **📊 Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, EMAs, volume analysis

## 🧠 Example Scenario

### You Manually Buy ETHUSDT

2. **Bot Immediately Tracks**:
   - Adds ETH to portfolio management
   - Starts monitoring price action
   - Watches for news mentions

3. **Continuous Analysis** (every 15 min):
   - Calculates RSI, MACD, EMAs
   - Scores recent ETH news sentiment
   - Computes hybrid score (e.g., 72/100)
   - Status: 🟡 HOLD

4. **If News Breaks**:
   - "JPMorgan adds Ethereum as collateral"
   - News score jumps to 85
   - Hybrid score → 78/100
   - Still 🟡 HOLD but monitoring

5. **If Technicals Break**:
   - RSI spikes to 76 (overbought)
   - MACD bearish divergence
   - Technical score drops to 35
   - Hybrid score → 58/100
   - Status: 🟠 WEAK HOLD

6. **If Both Turn Bad**:
   - Negative news: "SEC investigation"
   - RSI 80, MACD bearish, price -3%
   - Hybrid score → 28/100
   - Status: 🔴 SELL NOW
   - Bot recommends exit

## 📈 Benefits

### Before (Separate Systems)
- ❌ Manual trades: Only news-based decisions

- ✅ All trades: News + Technical
- ✅ Better entry/exit timing

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Recommendations Showing

1. Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
2. Verify you have holdings in Binance
3. Wait for first 15-min cycle to complete

### Hybrid Score Seems Wrong

- News score depends on recent articles (last 24h)
- If no news, defaults to 50 (neutral)
- Technical score needs at least 20 candles of data

### Charts Not Loading

- Check backend is running (`http://localhost:8000`)
- Verify `/api/portfolio/coin/{SYMBOL}` returns data
- Check browser console for errors

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Make sure backend is running** with updated code
2. **Rebuild frontend**: `cd tradingbot-frontend && npm run build`
3. **Navigate to** `/` (Dashboard)
4. **View Portfolio Management** section (bottom of page)
5. **Click any coin** to see detailed insights
6. **Click Trade** to buy/sell
