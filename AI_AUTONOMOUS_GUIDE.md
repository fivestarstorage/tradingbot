# 🤖 AI Autonomous Trading - Let AI Pick the Coins!

## 🎯 What Is This?

Instead of you choosing which coin to trade, **the AI scans ALL crypto news** and decides which coin has the best opportunity!

---

## 🆚 Difference from Regular AI News Trading

| Feature | AI News Trading | AI Autonomous Trading |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **You choose coin** | ✅ Yes (e.g., BTCUSDT) | ❌ No |
| **AI chooses coin** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes - AI picks! |
| **News coverage** | One coin only | ALL crypto news |
| **Trading flexibility** | Single pair | 15+ pairs |
| **Best for** | Focused trading | Opportunistic trading |

---

## 🚀 How It Works

```
1. AI scans ALL crypto news (last 2 hours)
   📰 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.

2. AI analyzes each article
   🤖 GPT-4 determines: impact, sentiment, urgency

3. AI ranks all opportunities
   📊 Sorts by: high impact > confidence > urgency

4. AI picks THE BEST coin to trade
   🎯 "Buy SOLUSDT - Major partnership announced!"

5. Bot executes on that coin
   💰 Places order on AI's chosen symbol
```

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Coin News Day

**News Feed:**
- "Bitcoin ETF approved" → 85% confidence BUY BTC
- "Ethereum upgrade successful" → 78% confidence BUY ETH  
- "Solana down due to outage" → 82% confidence SELL SOL

**AI Decision:**  
✅ **BUY BTCUSDT** (highest confidence + high impact)

---

### Scenario 2: Niche Opportunity

**News Feed:**
- "Avalanche partners with Amazon" → 92% confidence BUY AVAX
- "Minor Bitcoin price movement" → 45% confidence HOLD BTC

**AI Decision:**  
✅ **BUY AVAXUSDT** (higher confidence, bigger impact)

---

## 📊 Supported Coins

The AI can trade any of these 15 pairs:
- BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, BNBUSDT
- SOLUSDT, XRPUSDT, ADAUSDT
- DOGEUSDT, AVAXUSDT, DOTUSDT
- MATICUSDT, LINKUSDT, UNIUSDT
- LTCUSDT, ATOMUSDT, ETCUSDT

*More coins can be added easily!*

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Confidence Threshold
```python
self.min_confidence = 80  # Only trade 80%+ confident signals
```

**Adjust:**
- 90+ = Very conservative (rare trades, high quality)
- 80 = Balanced (recommended)
- 70 = Aggressive (more trades, more risk)

### Articles Analyzed
```python
self.max_articles_per_cycle = 10  # Check 10 articles per scan
```

**More articles = better coverage but higher API costs**

### Check Frequency
News is scanned every time the strategy is called (usually every 5-10 minutes)

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Per Scan (every 5-10 min):**
- Fetch news: FREE (NewsAPI)
- Analyze 10 articles: ~$0.10 (OpenAI)

**Daily:**
- ~150 scans/day = **$15/day**

**Monthly:**
- **~$450/month**

⚠️ **This is more expensive** than single-coin AI trading ($30/month)

**Cost Reduction Tips:**
1. Reduce `max_articles_per_cycle` to 5 → $7.50/day
2. Increase check interval to 15 min → $5/day
3. Use during active hours only → $3/day

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Already have AI News Trading setup?
**You're done!** Just select the new strategy in dashboard.

### 2. New to AI Trading?
Follow the `SETUP_AI_NEWS.md` guide first.

### 3. Test the Autonomous Strategy

```bash
cd /Users/rileymartin/tradingbot
python3 strategies/ai_autonomous_strategy.py
```

**Output:**
```
🤖 AI scanning crypto news for opportunities...
📰 Found 8 articles, AI analyzing...
🎯 AI recommends BUY SOLUSDT (confidence: 87%)

Signal: BUY
Recommended Coin: SOLUSDT
Confidence: 87%
Reasoning: AI chose SOLUSDT: Major partnership announcement...
```

## 📈 Using in Dashboard

### Create Autonomous Bot:

1. Open dashboard: `http://your_server:5000`
2. Click **"➕ Add New Bot"**
3. Settings:
   - **Name:** "AI Autonomous Trader"
   - **Symbol:** ANY (will be ignored - AI picks!)
   - **Strategy:** **"🤖 AI Autonomous (AI Picks Coin!)"**
   - **Trade Amount:** $100
4. Click **"Create Bot"**
5. Click **"▶ Start"**

### What Happens:

```
Bot starts...
→ AI scans all crypto news
→ Finds: "Ethereum scaling breakthrough!"
→ AI picks: ETHUSDT (92% confidence)
→ Bot buys ETH (not the symbol you set!)
→ Logs: "🟢 OPENED POSITION: ETHUSDT"
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Bot Logs:
```bash
screen -r bot_X  # Your bot ID
```

**Look for:**
```
🤖 AI scanning all crypto news for opportunities...
📰 Found 12 articles, AI analyzing...
🎯 AI recommends BUY SOLUSDT (confidence: 88%)
🟢 OPENED POSITION: SOLUSDT @ $143.50
```

### Dashboard Display:
- Shows which coin AI is currently trading
- Updates symbol dynamically
- Displays AI reasoning in logs

---

## ⚙️ Advanced: Filter to Crypto News Only

The strategy already filters for crypto-specific keywords:

```python
symbols=[
    'cryptocurrency', 'crypto', 'bitcoin', 'ethereum', 
    'blockchain', 'defi', 'web3', 'altcoin', 'binance'
]
```

**To add tech news:**
```python
symbols=[
    'cryptocurrency', 'crypto', 'bitcoin', 'ethereum', 
    'blockchain', 'defi', 'web3', 'altcoin',
    'technology', 'ai', 'metaverse', 'nft'  # Added tech
]
```

**To narrow to specific coins:**
```python
symbols=['bitcoin', 'ethereum', 'solana']  # Only these 3
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Symbol Parameter Ignored
When you create the bot, you set a symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT), but **AI ignores it** and picks its own!

### 2. Higher Costs
Analyzing more articles = higher OpenAI costs. Monitor usage at:
https://platform.openai.com/usage

### 3. Position Management
Bot can only hold ONE position at a time. If AI picks a new coin while holding another, it will:
- Close current position first
- Then open new position in AI's pick

### 4. Supported Pairs Only
AI can only trade pairs listed in `supported_symbols`. If news mentions a coin not on the list, it's ignored.

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Start Small
- First bot: $25-50
- Test for 1 week
- Increase if profitable

### Monitor Daily
- Check which coins AI is picking
- Review AI reasoning in logs
- Adjust confidence threshold if needed

### Combine Strategies
Run multiple bots:
- Bot 1: AI Autonomous ($100)
- Bot 2: Simple Profitable on BTC ($200)
- Bot 3: AI News on ETH ($100)

Diversification! 🎯

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No trading opportunities found"
→ AI confidence below threshold (80%)  
→ Lower `min_confidence` or wait for better news

### "Always picks Bitcoin"
→ BTC dominates crypto news  
→ Add filter to exclude BTC if you want altcoins

### "Too expensive!"
→ Reduce `max_articles_per_cycle` from 10 to 5  
→ Or use regular AI News Trading ($30/month)
