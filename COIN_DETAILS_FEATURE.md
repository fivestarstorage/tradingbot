## **🔧 Testing It Out**

1. **Open dashboard**: `http://134.199.159.103:5000`
2. **Look for your assets** (BTC, ETH, etc.)
3. **Click on any coin**
4. **Should see**: 
   - Loading spinner briefly
   - Then detailed modal with all info
   - If error, check browser console (F12)

---

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Clicking does nothing**
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Make sure dashboard is running latest version

### **Issue: Modal shows "Error loading coin details"**
**Possible causes:**
1. Binance API connection issue
2. Symbol not found on Binance
3. Network timeout

**Solution:**
- Check logs: `tail -f /root/tradingbot/flask.log`
- Verify Binance API keys are valid
- Restart dashboard

### **Issue: Shows "Not currently managed" but bot is running**
**Possible causes:**
1. Bot symbol doesn't match coin (e.g., bot has "BTCUSDT", coin is "BTC")
2. Bot just started and hasn't loaded position file yet

**Solution:**
- Wait 60 seconds for bot to sync
- Click "Refresh Status" button on main dashboard
- Check bot logs to see if position exists

### **Issue: P&L shows weird numbers**
**Possible causes:**
1. Entry price not saved properly (orphaned position)
2. Current price fetch failed

**Solution:**
- Close and reopen modal
- Check bot logs for actual entry price
- If orphaned position, P&L estimate may be off
