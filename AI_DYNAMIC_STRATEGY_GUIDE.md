# 🤖 AI Dynamic Strategy Adjustment Guide

## 🎯 **What's New?**

Your AI trading bots now have **TWO major enhancements**:

### ✅ **1. Hourly Fresh News Fetch**
- News cache: **1 hour** (was 8 hours)
- Fresh news every hour for timely trading
- More responsive to market changes

### ✅ **2. AI-Driven Dynamic Strategy Adjustment**
- AI analyzes news and **automatically adjusts trading parameters**
- Stop-loss, take-profit, confidence thresholds change based on news
- Trading strategy adapts to market conditions in real-time

---

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Old System (Static):**
```
Fixed stop-loss: 3%
Fixed take-profit: 5%
Fixed confidence: 70%

Same for all conditions ❌
```

### **New System (Dynamic):**
```
AI reads news → Detects:
├─ Risk Level: high/medium/low
├─ Urgency: immediate/high/moderate
├─ Sentiment: bullish/bearish/neutral
└─ Confidence: 0-100%

AI adjusts:
├─ Stop-loss: 2%-4%
├─ Take-profit: 3%-8%
├─ Confidence threshold: 50%-70%
└─ Hold time: 12h-48h

Strategy adapts automatically! ✅
```

```

## ❓ **FAQ**

### **Q: Does this use more OpenAI API calls?**
A: No! Same 1 call per news cycle. The adjustments happen in the same analysis.
